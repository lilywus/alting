# ALTing

### What's this?
A record of my time in Sapporo as an Assistant Language Teacher (ALT) on the JET Program! While I mostly wanted it to be a lesson database with some advice on working in a Japanese school, there's some fun extras as well! Built using HTML, CSS, various JavaScript libraries, and sheer willpower (infinite Git commits via Mac Terminal).

### Challenges

Although I have been slowly working through The Odin Project (you can view some of my work from that on my [Github profile](https://github.com/lilywus) and [portfolio](https://lilywus.github.io/)!, I'm still trying to gain more confidence in using JavaScript on the web. My current projects reflect my current skills, so everything is an ongoing work in progress!

Sometimes it's difficult going from concept to implementation, no matter how easy the task seems (it took me several hours to get a csv file read into Javascript?). I hope to grasp this process better through projects such as this!
