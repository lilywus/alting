Donut,Base,Flavor,Extras,Rating,FileName,Notes
Pon de Ring,Pon,Glazed,,S,pondering.jpg,My only gripe with Pon de Ring is that it never keeps well for more than a day...but that was before yakipon (pan-fried Pon de Ring) started trending on the internet. Now it can do no evil

Pon de Choco,Choco pon,Glazed,Limited edition,B,pondechoco.jpg,"It's fine, but nothing exciting"
Pon de Double Choco,Choco pon,Choco dip,Limited edition,C,pondedoublechoco.jpg,I feel like a double chocolate Pon de Ring should be more exciting. Why is it not more exciting?
